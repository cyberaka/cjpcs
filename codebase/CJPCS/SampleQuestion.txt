Q. Given the following code 
import java.io.*;
public class Th{
        public static void main(String argv[]){
        Th t = new Th();
        t.amethod();
        }
        public void amethod(){
                try{
                ioCall();
                }catch(IOException ioe){}
        }
        
}
What code would be most likely for the body of the ioCall method 
A. public void ioCall ()throws IOException{
        DataInputStream din = new DataInputStream(System.in);
        din.readChar();
        }
B. public void ioCall ()throw IOException{
        DataInputStream din = new DataInputStream(System.in);
        din.readChar();
        }
C. public void ioCall (){
        DataInputStream din = new DataInputStream(System.in);
        din.readChar();
        }
D. public void ioCall throws IOException(){     
   DataInputStream din = new DataInputStream(System.in);

Q. You have these files in the same directory. What will happen when you attempt to compile and run Class1.java if you have not already compiled Base.java 

//Base.java
package Base;
class Base{
        protected void amethod(){
                System.out.println("amethod");
        }//End of amethod
}//End of class base
package Class1;
//Class1.java
public class Class1 extends Base{

public static void main(String argv[]){
                Base b = new Base();
                b.amethod();
               }//End of main
}//End of Class1
A. Compile Error: Methods in Base not found 
B. Compile Error: Unable to access protected method in base class 
C. Compilation followed by the output "amethod" 
D. Compile error: Superclass Class1.Base of class Class1.Class1 not found 

ANSWER:D
